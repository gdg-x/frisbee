  <string name="gde_who_desc">Google Developer Experts (GDEs) are experts in one or more Google developer technologies. The GDE program recognizes the exemplary work done by these rock stars for the Google Developers worldwide by inviting them to be part of the growing GDE community.

  <string name="gde_what_title">What kind of activities do GDEs do?</string>
  <string name="gde_what_desc">GDEs write code and launch apps; they open source as much as possible of the code they write to benefit other developers. They have written and continue to write blog posts, articles, documentation, books, etc. about development on the Google platform.\n\nThey also translate existing documentation into other languages to benefit local developers. GDEs have high reps on forums like Stack Overflow and are top contributors on product mailing lists.\n\nThey speak at developer conferences, organize and lead GDGs, and conduct hackathons. GDEs can be nominated for the program for doing one or more types of activities for a product. Once they are accepted as a GDE, they are expected to continue contributing in any of the ways listed above.</string>
